        <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hello! My name is Armando Rebaza. I am a Computer Engineer currently working as a Finance Manager in Riverton, Utah. I enjoy learning new technologies, spending time with my family, and growing in faith and service. I'm excited to build web development skills in this course!</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on projects around the houseâ€”both inside and outside. Whether it is organizing a space, improving something functional, or simply creating a more inviting environment, I find joy in making our home a place of peace and purpose. These hands-on projects help me stay grounded and creative while also providing a sense of accomplishment.</p>

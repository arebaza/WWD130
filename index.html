      <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Armando Rebaza, and this moment reflects the heart of who I am.</p>
<p>I combine the expertise of a Computer Engineer by profession,</p>
<p>the responsibilities of a Finance Manager by role, and the curiosity of a lifelong learner by passion.</p>
<p>Faith, family, and service guide my steps, both in life and in the digital world I now explore.</p>
<p>Welcome to my journey — where code meets connection, and learning becomes legacy.</p>
<p> I enjoy learning new technologies. I'm excited to build web development skills in this course!</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy working on projects around the house—both inside and outside. 
<p>Whether it is organizing a space, improving something functional, or simply creating a more inviting environment</p>
<p> I find joy in making our home a place of peace and purpose.</p>
<p>These hands-on projects help me stay grounded and creative while also providing a sense of accomplishment.</p>
